**FPL Companion App - Feature Scope Document**

*The purpose of this document is to scope and organize a broad set of features for an FPL (Fantasy Premier League) companion app focused on fun, usability, and smarter squad management without engaging in predictive modeling or regression analytics.*

## Core Tenets

* **Focus on usability and fun**: Emphasis on experience, utility, and engagement rather than precision forecasting.
* **Enrich FPL engagement**: Help users manage squads, plan strategically, and interact meaningfully with their league and rivals.
